# NoSQL-Challenge

The NoSQL challenge features the setup and analysis of a restaurant database.

Within the Database Setup folder there is a notebook that shows how the database was created and an addition of another data entry.

Within the Database Analysis folder there is a notebook that gives analysis on the database and the creation of several queries and databases. 

Finally, the original JSON file could not be uploaded within this repo as the file was greater than the alloted 25MB per file.
